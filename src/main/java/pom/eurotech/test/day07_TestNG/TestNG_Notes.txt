Java: TestNG and Junit
C# : Nunit
Pyhton : pytest

TestNG allows us to run,organize tests, it can do assertions and verifications , generate reports.

@Test --> this is an annotation, it means the method after this @Test is TestNG method. We can run testNg test ,methods.

We can have multiple @Test s i one class
if we want to run specific test, right click to test name and run or click run button next to it.

To run all the tests inside the one class, right click run button next to the class name or click empty space inside the class
and run


@BeforeMethod --> runs once before each method with @Test annotations
@AfterMethod  --> runs once after each of with @Test annotations
============================

How to ignore some @Test to run?
@Ignore --> We can put on top of the @Test what we want to ignore
OR
we can comment out the @Test annotation
=============================

@BeforeClass --> runs only once before everything in the class
@AfterClass  --> runs only once after everything in the class

================================
Assertion -->this is the class in testNG , it has methods used to do assertion like when we compare values.
In testing , if assertion fails, rest of the method will NOT execute, it will be ignored/skipped.
If your code fail in one @Test annotations, it will not effect other @Test s, each if working independently.

Note: Whether your test case fail or not, your before and after method will execute ALWAYS. So even if your code
is fail, you can quit from driver, close browser.
