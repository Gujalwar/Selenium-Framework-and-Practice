Which one is lord of locators?

Id—> It will be always unique and first locator we are looking for. If there is an id attribute available for web element we will check is it dynamic or not.
If it is NOT changing ——static—- we can use it.

How to understand ID value is dynamic?
While we inspecting the element, refresh the page, if id value is changing we CAN’T use it. Refresh couple of times always to make sure.

Name—>If we cannot use ID, or it is dynamic we look for the name.
Name locator is not dynamic %99.99 time.
But name can be duplicate (radio buttons)

TagName—> If we cannot find name or id, we look for tagName

Class Name —> Another attribute for locating elements.
We will use it later to locate multiple elements in one shot.

When we shouldn’t use class name locator?
If there is a space in the class attribute value, we CANNOT use it.

LinkText—> Using full text of link to locate link web element on the web page

PartialLinkText—>using part of the link text to locate link web element
