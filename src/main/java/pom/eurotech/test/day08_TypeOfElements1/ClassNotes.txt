===============================
Radio Buttons
Radio button is a type of elements in which only one option can be selected
among group of options.
(Example : Gender - Male ,Female)

Based on the requirements you might or might not have default option selected.

isSelected()-->if radio button is selected it will return true, if not it will return false
isEnable()--> method that returns true if the button enable, if not return false
====================================
Checkboxes

Checkboxes are type of elements which can be selected or unselected.
When we have group of checkboxes selecting or unselecting one checkbox does NOT
affect in the selection of the other one.

Just like a radio buttons we use isSelected() method to check checkboxes are selected or not.
To select or unselect the checkbox we use click() method

======================================
isDisplayed() -- > method in Selenium verifies if a certain element is present and displayed.
If the element present (displayed) then the value returned true, if not returned false
