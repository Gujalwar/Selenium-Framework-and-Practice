WAITS
Thread.sleep();
this method is from Java, not selenium.It pauses the program based on
given milisecond.
It waits for the duration given. and be careful not use too long or less.

Implicit Wait
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

This wait come from selenium
1.Amount of time
2. Unit of time (Second,milisecond,day etc)

How find element methods work?
We provide locator and try to find elements to do some actions using findElement
method

if element found
        --It will return Web element
if element NOT found
        a)It will check do we have implicit wait?
            -it will keep trying to find element up to time we set
                1.If it is find with in time, it will return Web element
                2.If it can't find up to time, will return NoSuchElementExeption
        b)if there is no implicit wait , it will return NoSuchElementExeption

This waits for elements to be found in HTML, it only works when we call
findElement() methods.
Implicit wait only waits until the elements located.

implicit wait is set once, then you use rest of the program. If we have many
findElement() methods , they will all use the same implicit wait.

As long as findElement method finds the element on the HTML, it does NOT
care is it interactible, visible, clickible or not. It will return the element.
===========================================
Explicit Wait
Sometimes we might locate the element but we cannot interact with it within certain time.
we have to wait until it is visible, clickable, enable has certains text or dissapear.

When we have to wait for these cases, we will use explicit wait.
 2 steps to use explicit wait, first create the object pass parameter.
 WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,10);
 WebDriverWait -->class used explicit waits
 it takes 2 parameters driver , time in seconds
 use object to wait until specific conditions for webelement or case
 *wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(inputBox));*
 Explicit wait waits for the condition to complete, once condition is met, it
 will stop waiting.If the condition is not met and the time runs out and
 we got TimeoutException

 Implicit Wait
 call it once (set of driver)
 waits while trying to findElement
 wait until element found or time runs out
 applies for all findElement methods

 Explicit Wait
 call every time you need it
 wait until condition is met or time runs out
 wait for different conditions(interactible,visible,invisible,clickible etc)
