What is POM?

Page Object Model is a Design Pattern which is used in Selenium.

By Page Object Model, we can create java class for each page of the web application,
and store the relevant web elements and methods into their related classes. We can store related
re-usable utility methods in its "page" class as well. We are able to centralize re-usable important
test data which are in our configuration.properties and utility methods.

Instead of using .findElement method we use @FindBy annotation In this design pattern. Every time
we want to use WebElement which is located by using @FindBy annotation, it will be re-located in
the line that we are using.

StaleElementReferenceException is solved by POM Design pattern. Because every time we try to use
the WebElement, the reference of the Web Element will be refreshed. Therefore, no more StaleElementReferenceException.

We can use PAGE OBJECT MODEL DESIGN PATTERN, because we create centralized repository for our WebElements
and it provides REUSABILITY, LESS and CLEANER CODE, it is EASY TO MAINTAIN, and COLLABORATION BETWEEN TEAM
MEMBERS becomes EASIER.
